# Lesson 2 - The Basics

This lesson is divided up into small portions to cover "the basics". This includes
* [Ecmascript 5] [1]
* [globals] [2]
* [process] [3]
* [timers] [4]
* [Buffers] [5]

These cover the features that you should familiarize yourself with and also covers some of the commonly used features in node.js. 

Although most of these examples can be done in the REPL it might be a lot easier to run them from a file instead. Since we haven't covered that yet, running a script is easy. Create a file named anything (but for the sake of the example we'll call it helloworld.js) and put the following in it (don't feel intimidated, we'll cover these later):

	console.log('hello world'); 

Save it and from the command line type 
	node helloworld.js
That's it. Go ahead and advance to section one of this lesson, Ecmascript 5. 
[1]: ecmascript5
[2]: globals
[3]: process

[5]: Buffers
