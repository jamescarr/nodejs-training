# Globals
Now that we've covered some of the ES5 features available in node.js it is time to actually move on to some of the node specific stuff. You might have noticed the previous examples that used console.log to display text to the console. This is just one of the several global objects available within node.js

Just about every javascript interpreter has some form of global objects (in the browser global is usually window and global variables are attached to window) and node.js is no different. Here we'll cover the core global variables:

 * console
 * process
 * require
 * __filename
 * __dirname
 * module

## console



## process

### process.argv
### process.stdin
### process.stdout
### process.env
### process.nextTick
### Events

## __filename and __dirname
